# Iteration Management Specification

---

## Overview

Iteration management enables **comments to persist across code changes**. When code moves, is modified, or is deleted, comments automatically re-anchor to the correct location.

This a CodjiFlo's key differentiator - treating comment locations as a "continuous thread" across all code versions.

## Iteration Semantics

### What is an Iteration?

An iteration represents a **pull request revision** that authors would like reviewers to inspect. It can be interpreted as an augmented git tag with a snapshot of the before and after states of the codebase. It can then be analyzed and compared independently from the git history. Therefore, it is resilient to git force push - a diff between two iterations is constained to the union of files in them. Each iteration is immutable after creation. Users may diff any range of iterations they prefer. The latest iteration represents the desired state of the codebase once the pull request is closed.

```typescript
interface Iteration {
  id: number;                    // Server-assigned, immutable
  revision: number;              // Sequential 1-based number
  author: string;
  description: string;           // "Here's what changed..."
  comment: string;               // Author's notes
  submittedOn: Date;
  status: IterationStatus;       // Submitted, Deleted

  // Code changes
  changes: FileChange[];

  // Platform-specific metadata
  sourceCommitId?: string;       // For Git-based platforms
  targetCommitId?: string;
}

enum IterationStatus {
  Submitted = 'submitted',
  Deleted = 'deleted'
}
```

### The Snapshot Index System

Each iteration creates **TWO snapshots**:
- **Left snapshot** (even index) = state BEFORE this iteration
- **Right snapshot** (odd index) = state AFTER this iteration

```
Iteration 1:  Snapshot 0 (left)  ↔  Snapshot 1 (right)
Iteration 2:  Snapshot 2 (left)  ↔  Snapshot 3 (right)
Iteration 3:  Snapshot 4 (left)  ↔  Snapshot 5 (right)
```

### Index Conversion

- **Snapshot → Iteration:** `floor(snapshotIndex / 2) + 1`
- **Iteration → Left Snapshot:** `(iteration - 1) * 2`
- **Iteration → Right Snapshot:** `(iteration - 1) * 2 + 1`

**Examples:**
| Iteration | Index | Left Snapshot | Right Snapshot |
|-----------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 2 | 4 | 5 |

## Iteration Comparison

### Comparing Any Two Iterations

CodjiFlo supports comparing **any two iterations**, not just adjacent ones:

```typescript
interface IterationComparison {
  leftSnapshot: ReviewSnapshot;   // "Before" state
  rightSnapshot: ReviewSnapshot;  // "After" state
  files: FileComparison[];        // Per-file diffs
  isCrossIteration: boolean;      // True if not adjacent
}
```

### "What Changed Since I Last Looked"

To compare "after iteration 1" to "after iteration 3", use the right snapshots: snapshot 1 (after iter 1) vs snapshot 5 (after iter 3).

### Cross-Iteration Detection

A comparison is "cross-iteration" when not comparing adjacent left/right snapshots of the same iteration. The UI may display this differently (e.g., showing combined changes).

### File Matching Algorithm

Files are matched by artifact ID using a two-pointer merge:
- File only on left → deleted
- File only on right → added
- File on both → compare content to determine change type (edit, rename, unchanged)

---

## Comment Tracking Across Iterations

### The Core Problem

When code changes:
- Lines shift (insertions/deletions move line numbers)
- Content changes (same line, different text)
- Files rename/move
- Code is deleted entirely

Comments must **follow the code they reference**.

### The Three Snapshots (TripleSnapshot)

```typescript
interface TripleSnapshot {
  left: TextSnapshot;              // Original file content
  right: TextSnapshot;             // Modified file content
  both: ProjectionSnapshot;        // Merged view (for inline display)
  modifiedLinesInLeft: SpanCollection; // Which lines changed
}
```

The **projection snapshot** maps positions from both sides into a single coordinate space, enabling unified diff display.

### SpanTracker: Position Mapping

```typescript
interface ISpanTracker {
  leftSnapshotIndex: number;
  rightSnapshotIndex: number;

  // Map position from old version to new version
  trackSpanForward(span: TextSpan, matchFullReplacement: boolean): TextSpan;

  // Map position from new version to old version
  trackSpanBackward(span: TextSpan, matchFullReplacement: boolean): TextSpan;
}
```

### Comment Location Model

```typescript
interface CommentLocation {
  leftContribution: CommentFileLocation | null;   // Position in old version
  rightContribution: CommentFileLocation | null;  // Position in new version
  warning?: PlacementWarning;
}

interface CommentFileLocation {
  extent: TextSpan;        // Character position (start, length)
  startLineNumber: number; // 1-based line number
}
```

### The Core Algorithm: ComputeCommentLocation

Based on the comment's view context:
- **Left-only:** Comment was on deleted code; only left contribution exists
- **Right-only:** Comment was on added code; only right contribution exists
- **Both:** Comment on unchanged/context line; map through the projection to find contributions on each side. If it maps to only one side, treat as left-only or right-only.

### Tracking Through Multiple Iterations

To find a comment's position in a later iteration: chain span trackers from the original iteration through each subsequent iteration, tracking the span forward at each step. The final span is then used to compute the display location in the target iteration.

---

## Artifact Tracking

### File Lineage Across Iterations

Each file is tracked as an "artifact" with a consistent ID:

```typescript
interface ReviewFileArtifact {
  id: number;                          // Unique across review
  changeTrackingId: string;            // Platform-specific stable ID

  // Path at each snapshot (null if file doesn't exist)
  repoPaths: (string | null)[];

  // Existence range
  firstSnapshotIndex: number;
  lastSnapshotIndex: number;
}
```

### Handling Renames

When a file is renamed, the artifact stores both paths: the old path at the left snapshot index, the new path at the right snapshot index. This allows comments to follow files through renames.

---

## Platform Differences

### Azure DevOps (AzDO)

```typescript
interface AzDOIteration extends Iteration {
  // From AzDO API
  changeTrackingIds: Map<string, number>;  // Per-file tracking

  // Git-specific metadata
  sourceRefCommit?: string;    // PR source commit
  commonRefCommit?: string;    // Common ancestor

  // Features
  codeCoverage?: CoverageData;
}
```

**AzDO Advantages:**
- Character-level comment precision
- Explicit server-side iteration IDs
- Rich metadata per iteration
- Stable change tracking IDs

### GitHub

```typescript
interface GitHubIteration extends Iteration {
  commitSha: string;           // Git commit SHA
  baseSha: string;             // Base branch commit

  // Limitations
  commentPrecision: 'line';    // No character-level
}
```

**GitHub Limitations:**
- Comments anchor to lines, not characters
- Commit SHAs can change on force-push
- No server-side iteration concept
- Less precise tracking

### Capability Matrix

| Feature | Azure DevOps | GitHub | GitLab |
|---------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Iteration ID stability | ✓ Server-assigned | ✗ Commit SHA | ✗ Commit SHA |
| Character-level comments | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Force-push handling | ✓ | ✗ (comments lost) | ✗ |
| Create iteration | ✓ | ✗ (implicit) | ✗ |
| Code coverage | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

---

## Edge Cases

### Force-Pushed Commits

**Scenario:** User force-pushes, changing commit SHAs.

| Platform | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Azure DevOps | Comments persist (iteration IDs stable) |
| GitHub | Comments may be lost (reference old SHAs) |

### Rebased Branches

**Scenario:** Branch rebased onto new base.

```
Before rebase:
  main: A - B
  branch: A - B - C - D (comment on C)

After rebase:
  main: A - B - E
  branch: A - B - E - C' - D' (new SHAs)
```

**Behavior:**
- Azure DevOps: New iteration created, comments tracked via artifact ID
- GitHub: Comments reference old C commit, may fail to display

### Deleted Files with Comments

When the commented code is deleted:
1. Try to track the span forward (may return empty)
2. If empty, find the nearest unchanged region as an anchor
3. If no context remains, the comment becomes "orphaned" and floats to file level

### Squashed Commits

**Scenario:** Multiple commits squashed into one.

| Platform | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Azure DevOps | New iteration, comments tracked normally |
| GitHub | New commit SHA, old comments orphaned |

---

## Caching

**SpanTracker Cache:** Computing span trackers is expensive. Cache by snapshot pair key (e.g., `"2-3"`) and reuse.

**Identity Optimization:** When files are identical between snapshots, use a trivial tracker that returns spans unchanged.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Comment Thread Storage

```typescript
interface CommentThread {
  id: number;
  artifact: ReviewFileArtifact;

  // Immutable: where comment was originally created
  leftSnapshotIndex: number;
  rightSnapshotIndex: number;

  // Visual position (may differ from stored)
  displayLocation?: CommentLocation;

  isOfUncertainOrigin: boolean;  // If placed across changed region
}
```

### Invariants

1. **Left snapshot index is always even** (0, 2, 4, ...)
2. **Right snapshot index is always odd** (1, 3, 5, ...)
3. **Comments are immutable** - original location never changes
4. **Display location is computed** - derived from tracking

## Behavioral Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Compare any two iterations (not just adjacent)
- [ ] Comments track forward as code changes
- [ ] Comments track backward for historical comparison
- [ ] Handle file renames (artifact ID persists)
- [ ] Handle deleted files (anchor to context)
- [ ] Cache span trackers for performance
- [ ] Platform abstraction (AzDO, GitHub, GitLab)
- [ ] Graceful degradation for less-capable platforms
