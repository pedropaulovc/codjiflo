# Milestone 6: Real-time, Lifecycle & Settings (Gap Analysis)

**Goal**: Implement the remaining supporting features ensuring the application is a complete, production-ready review environment. This covers real-time updates, review status management, and personalization.

**Horizontal Requirements**:
- **Test Coverage**: 70% coverage.
- **Accessibility**: Status changes and real-time alerts must be announced via ARIA live regions. Settings panels must be fully accessible.

- **Accessibility**: Status changes and real-time alerts must be announced via ARIA live regions. Settings pannels must be fully accessible.

## Architecture & Scaffolding
*Implementation must follow `spec/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Focus on `api/realtime`.*

## [S-6.0] Story 6.0: Real-time Service Manager

As a developer, I want a centralized service to handle polling/socket connections so that the rest of the app just subscribes to updates.

### Description

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Service**:
    - [ ] [AC-6.0.1] `RealTimeService` created with `subscribe(event, callback)`.
    - [ ] [AC-6.0.2] Basic polling loop implementation.

## [S-6.1] Story 6.1: Real-time Updates

As a reviewer, I want to see new comments and changes appear instantly without refreshing the page so I'm always looking at the latest state.

### Description

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Mechanism**:
    - [ ] [AC-6.1.1] Poll for changes every X seconds (e.g., 30s) or listen to webhook events if a relay service is available.
    - [ ] [AC-6.1.2] Optimistically update UI when current user performs actions.
2.  **Indicators**:
    - [ ] [AC-6.1.3] specific toast notification when "New updates available" if auto-refresh is disabled.
